A statistical analysis of our results shows that those topics that rely on a clear understanding of pointers and memory-related concepts (such as copy constructors and virtual functions) prove to be the most difficult. In other words, we believe these concepts are only hard because of the student's inability to comprehend what is happening to their program in memory, as they are incapable of creating a clear mental model of its execution. These results would suggest that a clearer approach to teaching these topics would be beneficial to students. We are currently working on a visualization-based approach to address these issues.},

  abstract = {This document reviews basic linked list code techniques and then works through 18
linked list problems covering a wide range of difficulty. Most obviously, these problems
are a way to learn about linked lists. More importantly, these problems are a way to
develop your ability with complex pointer algorithms. Even though modern languages
and tools have made linked lists pretty unimportant for day-to-day programming, the
skills for complex pointer algorithms are very important, and linked lists are an excellent
way to develop those skills.
The problems use the C language syntax, so they require a basic understanding of C and
its pointer syntax. The emphasis is on the important concepts of pointer manipulation and
linked list algorithms rather than the features of the C language.
For some of the problems we present multiple solutions, such as iteration vs. recursion,
dummy node vs. local reference. The specific problems are, in rough order of difficulty:
Count, GetNth, DeleteList, Pop, InsertNth, SortedInsert, InsertSort, Append,
FrontBackSplit, RemoveDuplicates, MoveNode, AlternatingSplit, ShuffleMerge,
SortedMerge, SortedIntersect, Reverse, and RecursiveReverse.},

Our model is based on a set of values and practices that emphasize learning by doing together with continuous feedback as the most efficient means for learning. We show how the method was applied to a CS I programming course. Application of the method resulted in a significant decrease in the dropout rates in comparison with the previous traditionally conducted course instances.},

We identify general trends comparing novice and expert programmers, programming knowledge and strategies, program generation and comprehension, and object-oriented versus procedural programming. (We do not cover research relating specifically to other programming styles.) The main focus of the review is on novice programming and topics relating to novice teaching and learning. Various problems experienced by novices are identified, including issues relating to basic program design, to algorithmic complexity in certain language features, to the “fragility” of novice knowledge, and so on. We summarise this material and suggest some practical implications for teachers. We suggest that a key issue that emerges is the distinction between effective and ineffective novices. What characterises effective novices? Is it possible to identify the specific deficits of ineffective novices and help them to become effective learners of programming?},

The study examined students’ behavior in class and their perceptions of the new learning environment throughout three consecutive semesters. An online survey revealed that students have highly positive perceptions about the use of wireless laptops, but less positive perceptions about being active in class. Class observations showed that the use of wireless laptops enhances student-centered, hands-on, and exploratory learning as well as meaningful student-to-student and student-to-instructor interactions. However, findings also show that wireless laptops can become a source of distraction, if used for non-learning purposes.},

It starts by presenting a fairly idiosyncratic view of teaching programming which makes use of mechanistic analogies and points out some of the pitfalls. The article goes on to examine certain errors based on the misapplication of analogies as well as certain interaction errors. The main emphasis is on the notional machine both at the general level of understanding (and misunderstanding) the relationship of the terminal to the computer as such, as well as at the more specific level of understanding assignment. Notation and mistakes that poorly-designed languages can induce novices to commit are discussed.},
